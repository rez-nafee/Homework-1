In this assignment, you will be the accountant for Jack's general bank account and will write a general ledger to help him keep track of his financial transactions. The general ledger is simply a list where an individual can record their transactions, or the buying and selling of a product or service. A transaction contains general information such as the date, amount (or the change in cash as a result of the transaction), and description. The general ledger should be able to record a total of 50 transactions.
